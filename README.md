# dc-runner-php

PHP implementation lane for Data Contracts runner compatibility.

## What This Project Is

`dc-runner-php` provides PHP runner interfaces and compatibility checks for Data
Contracts workflows. It verifies behavior against a pinned upstream specs
snapshot so compatibility changes are explicit and reviewable.

## What Is Data Contracts?

[Data Contracts](https://github.com/jonruttan/data-contracts) is the canonical
contracts/specifications project for the runner ecosystem. It owns normative
contracts, schemas, conformance surfaces, and governance policy.

This repository does not redefine those canonical contracts. It owns PHP
implementation behavior and compatibility verification against pinned upstream
versions.

## Responsibility Boundary

- `data-contracts` owns canonical runner specs/contracts and evolution.
- `dc-runner-php` owns PHP implementation behavior and compatibility checks.

## Stable Interface Contract

- Public runner entrypoint: `/runner_adapter.sh`
- Stable exit code semantics:
  - `0` success
  - `1` runtime/tool failure
  - `2` invalid usage/config

## Quickstart

Core checks:

```sh
make lint
make smoke
```

Full local verification:

```sh
make verify
```

## Upstream Snapshot Workflow

Pinned upstream compatibility artifacts:

- `/specs/upstream/data_contracts_lock_v1.yaml`
- `/specs/upstream/data-contracts.manifest.sha256`
- `/specs/upstream/data-contracts/`

Update pinned snapshot:

```sh
make spec-sync TAG=<upstream-tag-or-ref> SOURCE=<path-or-url>
```

Validate lock/snapshot integrity:

```sh
make spec-sync-check
```

Run compatibility verification:

```sh
make compat-check
make runner-spec-check
```
